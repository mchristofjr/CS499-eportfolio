## Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering (Milestone Two)

This enhancement builds upon the original CRUD Python module reviewed in Milestone One.  
The focus of this enhancement was improving software design quality, readability, maintainability, and robustness while preserving the original functionality.

### Key Improvements

- Added comprehensive docstrings and inline comments for improved clarity  
- Introduced consistent type hints across all methods  
- Strengthened input validation and defensive programming  
- Improved exception handling at database boundaries  
- Refactored method structure for cleaner, more maintainable code

## Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures (Milestone Three)

This enhancement builds upon the same CRUD module but focuses specifically on refining its internal algorithmic structure and data handling logic. While the previous enhancement emphasized software design quality, this phase concentrates on structured control flow, centralized validation, and predictable decision-making within CRUD operations.

### Key Algorithmic Improvements

- Introduced helper methods to normalize query filters before execution  
- Centralized dictionary validation to reduce duplicated conditional logic  
- Simplified branching decisions in update and delete operations  
- Standardized early-return patterns for predictable method behavior  
- Improved consistency in how data structures are validated and processed  

These refinements demonstrate the practical application of algorithms and data structures within backend systems, emphasizing clarity, correctness, and maintainability.

## Enhancement Three: Databases (Milestone Four)

This enhancement focuses on improving database interaction patterns and performance within my CS 340 Animal Shelter CRUD module. The goal was to strengthen data access efficiency and reliability by adding query shaping features and database performance considerations while preserving the artifact’s original purpose.

### Key Database Improvements

- Added projection support to reduce unnecessary data transfer and improve read efficiency
- Added optional sorting and limiting to prevent accidental full-collection reads during analysis
- Added index creation support to improve performance for common dashboard query fields
- Improved predictable result handling to support UI and dashboard usage patterns
